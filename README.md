# vue-minesweeper
## About
This clone of the classic game, "Minesweeper", was built over a weekend using Vue.js 2.0.  It features a timer, multiple difficulty settings, and tile-flagging.  It is responsive with pure CSS media queries (though the grid itself is still a bit 'rigid' at this time).

This is my first real project using a newer Javascript framework, and I created this right after finishing [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Vue Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide).
